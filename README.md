This repository will contain Colab/Jupyter notebook code for creating watermark on an image(for example , BMW logo)
# BMW Logo Watermarker

## Overview

This project demonstrates how to apply watermarks to images using Python libraries OpenCV and PIL (Python Imaging Library). The goal is to add both a logo and text watermark to an image, ensuring they are correctly resized and positioned. In this example, we use a BMW logo as the watermark.

## Features

- **Load and Resize Images**: Fetch and prepare images for watermarking.
- **Apply Logo Watermark**: Resize and overlay a BMW logo onto the image.
- **Add Text Watermark**: Overlay text onto the image using OpenCV.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- Libraries: `opencv-python`, `numpy`, `Pillow`, `requests`, `IPython`

You can install the required libraries using pip:


pip install opencv-python numpy Pillow requests ipython
